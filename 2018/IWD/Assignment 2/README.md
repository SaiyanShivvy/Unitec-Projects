# IWD - Project 2 - Shivneel Achari

# Wordpress
http://dochyper.unitec.ac.nz/iwd18s1/2379/achars05IWD/wordpress/

# Instructions
Its an HTML file nothing special, just load index.html. 
Used Bootstrap 4.1 for UI.

## Notes:
Documentation holds the Checkpoint 1, 2, and Assignment Cover aswell as other docs.
Storyboard is for the inital design, didn't have enough ink to print another one before due date.

### Bugs and other known issues:
- Game score issue regarding collision and remove of object from array. 
- Mute buttons not correctly function, though they should followed w3schools example for HTML Audio/Video DOM Elements.
- Booking isn't really persistant local storage, couldn't figure that one out. 
- Changing time doesn't reset the boat, since its held in a single array and wasn't sure on how to refresh the table.
- Wordpress just contains docs.
- UI might look weird, first time using bootstrap.

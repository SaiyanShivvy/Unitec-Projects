# Unitec Projects Repo

## Intro

This Repo contains source code from assignment I completed at Unitec for my Bachelor's Degree.
Some projects have their own repo.

### Notes

This doesn't have any assignments from Year 1 (2016), as I wasn't really used to using GitHub or BitBucket at the time.

### Additional Tasks

Creating a seperate git repo for each project so it's better documented and easier to access, and this would act as a hub or house uncatergorized project.
